                    <p> 
                        Too much time is wasted looking for places to eat, especially when it is a mutual
                        decision. The wasted time can lead to irritability and an increase of negative
                        emotions on top of the fact that this is usually accompanied by hunger.

                        My group and I worked together to generate different ideas related to our app. We 
                        created several categories related to what our app should do and created an affinity diagram
                        that has a collection of post-it notes with our ideas. Some of the ideas we explored were how 
                        we could make this app more accessible to users, how we could implement locational data, and 
                        how we could utilize data storage for each particular user.
